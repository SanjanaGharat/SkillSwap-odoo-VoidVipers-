A web application that enables users to exchange skills with others in their community.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge:
Many people want to learn new skills but face barriers like:
- High costs of courses/tutorials

### Current Gaps:
1. No centralized platform for reciprocal skill sharing
2. Existing platforms focus on paid services or one-way teaching
